Multilevel Modeling is designed to provide graduate students with a practical, applied approach to the **clustered and/or longitudinal data**. Students will learn how to differentiate and appropriately select the best statistical methods for use in various research designs and analytical problems. This includes Multilevel Modeling (MLM), which also goes by such names as Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and Mixed Effects Regression (MER), Generalized Multilevel Modeling (GzMLM), and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).

# **Focus**

Mastery of the material covered in this course will enable students to develop the skills necessary to conduct well-planned behavioral and educational research involving **clustered or longitudinal designs,** and thoughtful statistical analyses of the resulting data. Knowledge gained in this course will build upon concepts learned in prior research methodology and data analysis courses. Students will learn how to differentiate and appropriately select the best statistical methods for use in various clustered or longitudinal research designs.

As the theoretical is secondary to the applied approach to data analysis in this course, students will learn how to:

1.  Use the `R` statistical programming environment *(via the `R Studio` IDE)* to analyze **clustered and longitudinal** data and

2.  Interpret and communicate the results of their analyses *(including creating reproducible research reports with R Markdown)*.

This course will only emphasize methods for manifest or observed, rather than latent or unobserved, variables.

> Successful completion of EDUC/PSY 7610 or an equivalent course in *single level* multiple linear regression is required.

## **Structure**

This is a lecture and applied skills course and students will be expected to demonstrate their learning via classroom participation, written assignments, and a presentation. Much of the basic material will be presented in readings (textbook and supplements) and pre-recorded lectures which students will view prior to class. The purpose of class time (on Zoom) is to elaborate on interesting or difficult material presented in the text, conduct skill-building exercises and demonstrations, and to provide a forum for class discussions in more of a lab fashion. We will frequently use a hands-on approach in class, working through analyses together via computer software.
