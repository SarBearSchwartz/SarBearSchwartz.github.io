    ## Software

    [Vol. 0 - Setting up your computer](https://sarbearschwartz.github.io/v0_install/)

    Installing software *(R, RStudio, packages, TeX)*

    Workspace orientation

    Notebook workflow

    Periodic updating

    ## Wrangling

    [Vol. 1 - Data Management](https://cehs-research.github.io/eBook_wrangle/)

    -   Importing data files (SPSS, Excel, CSV, ect.)

    -   Sub-setting (observations and variables)

    -   Creating new variables

    -   Saving revised data

    ## Explore

    [Vol. 2 Exploratroy Data Analysis](https://cehs-research.github.io/eBook_explore/)

    Computing and tabulating summary statistics (M/SD, count/%)

    Creating descriptive visualizations of distributions (boxplots, histograms) and relationships (scatter plots)

    ## ANOVA

    [Vol. 3 Testing Mean Differences](https://cehs-research.github.io/eBook_ANOVA/)

    t-tests (independent groups, paired observations)

    ANOVA (independent or between subjects, 1-way, 2-way)

    RM ANOVA (repeated measures, between subjects)

    Mixed ANOVA (both independent and between subjects)

    Visualizations (marginal means to prob interactions)

    Post hoc tests (multiple corrections, contrast statements)

    ## Regression

    [Vol. 4 Multiple Linear Regression & GLM](https://sarbearschwartz.github.io/v4_regression/)

    Calculating and visualization correlation

    Multiple regression models (fitting, tabulating results, graphical probing interactions)

    Generalizing the distribution (GLM: logistic regression, poisson regression, ect.)

    Moderation and Mediation

    Average Marginal Effects

    ## Multilevel

    [Vol. 5 Multilevel and Marginal Models](https://sarbearschwartz.github.io/v5_mlm/)

    Modeling clustered/hierarchical or longitudinal/repeated observations with multilevel models (MLM, LMM, GLMM, HLM), including:

    Computing ICCs

    Model fitting

    Tabulating results

    Visualizing (marginal means to prob interactions)

    Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)
