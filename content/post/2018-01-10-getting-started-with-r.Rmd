# According to [R Studio](www.rstudio.com):

> "R Markdown is a format that enables easy authoring of reproducible web reports from R. It combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy-to-write **plain text** format for web content) with embedded **R code chunks** that are run so their output can be included in the final document".

Introduction to creating dynamic R statistical reports in PDF or HTML:

-------------------------------

## What do you mean by **dynamic**? 

The **traditional way** to write a report is:

1. Run your analysis in software, like SPSS or R and manually save our output
    * *i.e. saving the ANOVA table or using pdf() to save the graphs*  

2. Type your your description and interpretation in a text editor like *Word*
    * *either drag/drop tables and figures, or worse copy-paste and retype all the numbers*

A report written in this way can be problematic.  For instance, imagine your *Mentor/collaborator/journal reviewer*  telling you that they want to use a sub-sample instead of the entire sample. Or to include a nother variable.  You would have to redo all of your work!! 

Therefore, in this way **dynamic also means reproducible**, in the sense that people who get the file from you can reproduce the entire work in the report.


-------------------------------

## How does **R Markdown** work out to be a **.pdf** or **.html** file? 

`R Markdown` is a file with the file extension **.Rmd**, the `knitr` package will then transform the file into a **Markdown** file with the extension **.md.** Then Rstudio can:

  * Use `LaTeX` to transform the file into a **.pdf** 
    
  * Load another package called `markdown` to transform the file into **.html**   
    
  * Use Pandoc to even convert to file to a **Word** document (ugly)



## Is this a **popular** method for creating reports? 

Check out [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/). This website shares lots of documents written in the way we will introduce below.

## Background Information

> `R Markdown` documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive **notebook** interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.

> `knitr` is an engine for dynamic report generation with R. It is a package in the statistical programming language R that enables integration of **R code** into LaTeX, LyX, HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, and **text** documents.

# Three Downloads to Install

![](/img/Rlogo_200.png)

## 1. `R` from [www.r-project.org](www.r-project.org)

Get the latest released version of FREE **Base** R from CRAN 

* Choose a mirror close to your location
* Select **base** R for your computer *(Windows, Mac, ect.)*
* The defaults are good...don't change them...just keep clicking *'Next'*

-------------------------------

## 2 `R Studio` from [www.rstudio.com](www.rstudio.com)

Get the latest version of the FREE Open Source **Desktop** Edition of R Studio

* The defaults are good...don't change them...just keep clicking *'Next'*

-------------------------------

## 3. `LaTeX` depends on your operating system


> **Mac:** `MacTeX` from [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/) 

* Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the **PKG file**
* Follow the installation instructions.
* You don't need to open anything after MacTeX is finished installing.  
    
     
    
> **Windows:** `MikTeX` [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download)

* Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic! 
* You need the full version 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine
* When your download is complete, run the downloaded installer. 
* Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes!**
* This is the slowest part...
