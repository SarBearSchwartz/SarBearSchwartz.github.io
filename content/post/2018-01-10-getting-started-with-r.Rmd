# Three Downloads to Install

![](/img/Rlogo.png)

## 1. `R` from [www.r-project.org](www.r-project.org)

Get the latest released version of FREE **Base** R from CRAN 

* Choose a mirror close to your location
* Select **base** R for your computer *(Windows, Mac, ect.)*
* The defaults are good...don't change them...just keep clicking *'Next'*

## 2 `R Studio` from [www.rstudio.com](www.rstudio.com)

Get the latest version of the FREE Open Source **Desktop** Edition of R Studio

* The defaults are good...don't change them...just keep clicking *'Next'*

## 3. `LaTeX` depends on your operating system


> **Mac:** `MacTeX` from [http://tug.org/mactex/](http://tug.org/mactex/) 

* Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the **PKG file**
* Follow the installation instructions.
* You don't need to open anything after MacTeX is finished installing.  
    
     
    
> **Windows:** `MikTeX` [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download)

* Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic! 
* You need the full version 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine
* When your download is complete, run the downloaded installer. 
* Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes!**
* This is the slowest part...
