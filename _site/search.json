The purpose of class time (on Zoom) is to elaborate on interesting or difficult material presented in the text, conduct skill-building exercises and demonstrations, and to provide a forum for class discussions in more of a lab fashion. We will frequently use a hands-on approach in class, working through analyses together via computer software.",
